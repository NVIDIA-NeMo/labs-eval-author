# Development

## Validation

When adding NVIDIA-authored files or changing dependencies, update the tracked
licensing artifacts first:

```bash
make update-copyright-headers
make update-licenses
```

For dependency changes, run `uv add <package>` and `make update-licenses`, review
the generated diff, and commit it. Generation requires `osv-scanner` 2.3.3 on `PATH`
and automatically collects license and attribution texts for locked runtime
dependencies and all extras into `third_party/NOTICES.txt`, with indexes in
`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` and `third_party/licenses.jsonl`.

Only exceptions require manual work: if a distribution omits its license, add a
version-specific, checksum-pinned upstream document in `third_party/license_exceptions.yaml`.
Unknown license terms require a shared text under `third_party/license_texts/` and,
where necessary, a reviewed compatibility entry in `third_party/license_overrides.yaml`.
The standard texts were sourced from SPDX license-list-data commit
`16f3aa6c3bdd62e50f8b1cf618f32d2a510250ee`; original package notices are retained separately.

`make check-licenses` verifies the generated disclosures. Scanner intermediates and
download caches live in ignored `tmp/`; a cold cache requires network access.
These notices cover this source distribution;
shipping containers or bundled native environments requires collecting notices from
those actual artifacts too, since platform wheels can bundle additional libraries.

Run the same read-only checks used by CI:

```bash
make check-copyright-headers
make check-licenses
uv run --locked ruff check .
uv run --locked ruff format --check .
uv run --locked pytest
```
