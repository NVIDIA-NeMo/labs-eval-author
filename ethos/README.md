# ethos.md

`ethos.md` is the **intent layer** for a production agent: a Markdown snapshot
of what the agent is for, what it must not do, and what success looks like.
Developers, reviewers, evaluators, and the coding agents working on the agent
read it to detect and resolve divergence between developer intent and agent
execution.

Code shows implementation. ethos.md records mission, constraints, and what
success and failure mean.

This directory holds two coding-assistant skills that create and maintain an
`ethos.md`:

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`ethos-explore`](skills/ethos-explore/SKILL.md) | Reads the agent's code and docs, fills in what they establish, then asks one intent question at a time for what they cannot. Hands its answers to `ethos`. |
| [`ethos`](skills/ethos/SKILL.md) | Writes `ethos.md` from those answers using the [schema-v2 template](skills/ethos/references/templates/ethos.md), validates the front matter and required sections, and reviews the result with you. |

## Why it exists

Critical agent context lives outside the codebase: business objectives,
developer intent, success and failure criteria, and hard constraints. It is
rarely written down. An agent or evaluator that sees only code and traces
cannot tell a real failure from a trade-off you already accepted.

Without an ethos.md, every new agent, review, or eval has to rediscover that
context, and changes align with whatever the traces happen to show. With one,
the same file can steer a new build, guide a review of logs and evals, reveal
divergence from intent, and keep changes inside human-set bounds.

## Scattered context, one contract

Intent arrives in pieces:

- **Codebase:** files, docs, configs, and logic. What the agent does today.
- **Traces and logs:** telemetry, errors, and metrics. How a run looked, not
  whether that was acceptable.
- **Business goals:** objectives, value, and the result the agent is accountable for.
- **Developer intent:** tone, priorities, and judgment calls that never made it
  into a ticket.
- **Constraints:** limits, policies, and guardrails no change may cross.

`ethos.md` is the portable snapshot of that contract. Write the intended state,
not only the implemented one; where they differ, say so.

## What it unlocks

| It unlocks | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Portable context** | Every developer, reviewer, and agent working on this agent starts from the same file instead of reconstructing intent from the repo. |
| **Shared contract** | Humans and agents agree on purpose, bounds, and what counts as divergence. |
| **Spec-driven creation** | Purpose, goals, and expected behavior are explicit before code exists. |
| **Safe changes** | Anyone changing the agent knows its hard constraints, trade-offs, and what must not regress. |
| **Recursive updates** | Intent clarified while reviewing a change, eval, or finding goes back into the file. A stale ethos.md steers the next change the wrong way. |

## ethos.md is not `AGENTS.md`

| | `AGENTS.md` | `ethos.md` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When it matters | Any repository a coding agent should navigate | When the repository, or a package in it, *is* an agent |
| Job | How to contribute: layout, conventions, commands | Intent, goals, and constraints |
| Location | Repository root | Next to the agent |

## What's in the file

YAML front matter (`schema_version`, `name`, `created_timestamp`, `author`, and
optional `owner` and `updated_timestamp`) followed by fourteen required sections.
Section bodies stay human-readable; the headings are the outline other agents
parse. A section with nothing to say contains `_(none)_`.

| Section | Captures |
| --- | --- |
| `Role` | What the agent does, in one concrete sentence. |
| `Purpose & Outcomes` | Why it exists, and the result it is judged by. |
| `Scope` | Who it serves, in-scope work, and boundaries. |
| `Tools` | APIs, tools, and knowledge sources it can use. |
| `Harness` | How the agent actually runs. |
| `Behavior` | Rules, tone, refusals, and policies. |
| `Principles` | How to decide when no rule in `Behavior` covers the case. |
| `Success Criteria` | What good production behavior looks like. |
| `Trade-offs` | Hard gates, priority order, and unacceptable regressions. |
| `Constraints` | Limits no change may cross. |
| `Evaluation Setup` | How it is tested and measured. |
| `Metric Semantics` | What metric names mean, and the claims they do not support. |
| `Vision` | Where the agent is headed, beyond today's scope. |
| `Open Questions` | Unknowns to resolve. |

## Create an ethos.md

Install both skills together; `ethos-explore` hands off to `ethos`:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-eval-author/tree/main/ethos --agent claude-code
```

Replace `claude-code` with your assistant's identifier. Then, in your agent's
repository, ask your coding assistant:

```text
Use ethos-explore to capture what my agent should do, then write its ethos.md.
```

`ethos-explore` scans the codebase first and asks at least three intent
questions, covering purpose and outcomes, principles, and vision. `ethos`
writes `ethos.md` at the repository root, or at a path you name, validates it,
and asks you to review it. Commit it with the agent's code. You can also write
the file by hand from the [template](skills/ethos/references/templates/ethos.md)
and check it with the bundled validator:

```bash
python3 ethos/skills/ethos/scripts/validate_ethos.py path/to/ethos.md
```

To revise an existing ethos.md, ask for the edit directly; `ethos` updates the
relevant sections in place and sets `updated_timestamp`. Both skills also find
an `ETHOS.md` written by Eval Author 0.1.0; `ethos` renames it to `ethos.md` and
upgrades it to schema version 2 when it writes.

## Using ethos.md with Eval Author

Eval Author's first evaluations and coverage audits use ethos.md as their target
and hand off to these skills to create or revise it. Installing Eval Author
(`npx skills add NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-eval-author --skill '*'`) does not install
them; add them with the command above.
