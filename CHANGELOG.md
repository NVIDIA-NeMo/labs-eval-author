# Changelog

Notable changes to NeMo Eval Author are recorded here. Eval Author is a research
preview: workflows, skills, and saved artifacts may change between releases.

## 0.1.0

Initial research-preview release, tested with Harbor 0.20.0 and NeMo Gym v0.6.0.
To install exactly this version, clone the `v0.1.0` tag and follow the
[manual installation steps](docs/getting-started.md#manual-installation-without-nodejs).

### Added

- **Eleven skills that install together**, with `eval-author` as the entry point
  that selects a workflow and saves its output under `.eval-author/`. See
  [Get started](docs/getting-started.md) and the
  [skill reference](DEVELOPMENT.md#skill-reference).
- **Ethos authoring** with the bundled [`ethos` skill](skills/ethos/SKILL.md),
  which records your agent's purpose, boundaries, and success criteria in a
  local `ETHOS.md` that first evaluations and audits build on.
- **First evaluations for NeMo Gym or Harbor.** Agree on a reviewed plan, build
  a starter suite in a proven environment, and validate each task before
  evaluating your agent. See [Build your first evaluations](docs/first-evals.md).
- **Discovery and readiness checks.** Inventory the evaluations in a repository
  and check whether its Gym and Harbor suites are ready to run. See
  [Find existing evaluations](docs/getting-started.md#find-existing-evaluations)
  and [Check readiness](docs/existing-evals.md#check-readiness).
- **Guided coverage audits.** Define what your evaluations should cover, measure
  coverage from ATIF traces, and review gaps in a readable Audit coverage report.
  See [Audit coverage](docs/existing-evals.md#audit-coverage).
- **Proposals and task creation.** Turn audit findings into ranked
  recommendations, and create a Gym or Harbor task for an eligible, measured
  tool-coverage gap. See
  [Propose new evaluations](docs/existing-evals.md#propose-new-evaluations) and
  the [Gym task-authoring guide](skills/eval-author-task-create/references/gym-tasks.md).
- **Reviewable, rerunnable suites.** Each generated suite gets a `README.md` with
  a case inventory and rerun commands, and Gym records and ATIF traces open in an
  offline HTML reader. See
  [Review generated cases](docs/results.md#review-generated-cases) and
  [Open readable cases and traces](docs/results.md#open-readable-cases-and-traces).
- **Trace tools.** Explain a NeMo Intake trace and convert MLflow and Gym traces
  to ATIF. See [Inspect an Intake trace](docs/traces.md#inspect-an-intake-trace)
  and [Convert local traces](docs/traces.md#convert-local-traces).
- **Experimental trace-to-environment workflow**, which derives a private Harbor
  or native Gym task from trace evidence. See
  [Build an evaluation task](docs/traces.md#build-an-evaluation-task).
